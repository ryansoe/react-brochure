# Brochure Generator

This is a web app that generates a travel brochure based on user input.

The app takes a city name from the user, then it generates a brochure that contains top restaurants, cities, weather, and attactions in the area. The app will also list famous people from the area and provide a brief historical description of the city. All of this data is obtained through web scraping from websites such as Yelp and Wikipedia.

Front end: Javascript, React, NodeJS, HTML, CSS
Backend: Flask, Python (modules used are Beautiful Soup, GeoPy, and Selenium)
